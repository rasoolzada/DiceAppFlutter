# DiceAppFlutter

DiceAppFlutter is a Flutter application that simulates rolling two dice for two players. The application includes score counters for each player, as well as a main counter for the total number of swings of the dice. Once the main counter reaches 20, the scores reset, and the player with the highest score becomes the winner.
